####YOU MUST HAVE SOME SOFTWARE INSTALLED FOR THIS SCRIPT TO WORK PROPERLY,
####FIRST, YOUTUBE-DL, THE PROGRAM THAT THIS HOLE SCRIPT IS BASED ON
####AND, FFMPEG, THAT YOUTUBE-DL REQUIRES FOR DOWNLOAD AUDIO FROM VIDEOS
###TO INSTALL THOSE THINGS, YOU MUST RUN

sudo apt install youtube-dl ffmpeg ##for debian and ubuntu based distros
sudo dnf install youtube-dl ffmpeg ##for fedora/centOS
sudo zypper install youtube-dl ffmpeg ##for OpenSUSE
sudo pacman -S youtube-dl ffmpeg##for arch linux
##for other distros, check ur package manager

##to run the command whenever you want (enabling it globally, you MUST run the configure)

##nothing prevents you from copying the script to your /bin folder, that is what
##the configure file does, lol
