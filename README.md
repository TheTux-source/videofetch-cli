[Liberties]

You are totally free to modify, redistribute, totally anything you want to do
with this software, but, i would really appreciate if you mentioned me and this
original code while redistributing it, i know this thing it's not that good,
but, you know, i made it with love, xD.

[Dependencies]

This script uses bash with youtube-dl, so, you will need him and ffpmeg for
totally functionality, i would also recommend mpv for playing things later.

[The "configure" file]

The configure file is REALLY simple, it just moves the script to the /bin folder
to enable the script globally in your GNU/linux system.

**REMEMBER TO GIVE EXECUTING PERMISSIONS TO THE FILES**

**sudo chmod +x configure**
**sudo chmod +x videofetch**
